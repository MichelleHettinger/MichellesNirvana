                <h1 style="text-align:center">The Coconut-Flower</h1>
                <p>Imagine the most beautiful flower you've ever laid eyes on. The kind of beauty that stops the mind in its tracks.
                   This flower was once placed inside a hallowed out coconut which was then sealed, wrapped in a gift box and sent to one sentient being. </p>
                <p>Upon opening the gift this being fell into confusion and anger. "Who the hell would send me such a drab, hard-shelled and ugly fruit.
                   I don't even like the taste of coconuts!" The coconut was promptly tossed into the corner of the room.</p>
                <p>Over the next few years the coconut-flower would become lost under an ever increasing pile of acquired possessions.
                   During this time the sentient being spiraled further into an ever worsening suffering mind.
                   This suffering mind was enough to spark a change in sentient being.</p>
                <p>Cleaning up the mess wasn't easy and low levels of suffering mind lingered, but enough garbage was excavated to uncover the coconut-flower.
                   Sentient being examined the coconut once again and noticed that it looked distinctly different than before.
                   The coconut was radiating vibrantly. And even though the coconut still looked drab on the surface, the beingn-ess of the object was appreciated.
                   Its very existence was special and beautiful in its own right.</p>
                <p>Curious to discover how the taste of the coconut may have changed sentient being attempted to crack open the coconut, but the shell was too rigid to penetrate - force alone would not unravel the coconut.
                   Bewildered and angry the being tortured this coconut, beating the coconut-flower mercilessly all the while thinking to himself "I am a man! I am strong! This shell should be no match for me!"</p>
                <p>Frustrated at what seemed to be a failure sentient being tossed the coconut aside and began to spiral into an ever worsening suffering mind.
                   Like a black hole, this pain sucked all life energy into its core, leaving no trace of joy, happiness, love or unity.
                   Eventually this black hole of death reached its breaking point and collapsed under its own weight.</p>
                <p>Amidst a heavy stupor sentient being glanced at the coconut while reluctantly accepting defeat and noticed a vibrant near blinding glow coming from the coconut.
                   Examining the coconut-flower revealed a tiny crack through which the flower could be seen.
                   Time froze, mind was clear, and a wonderful sensation arose within sentient being.
                   Few people would ever lay their eyes on such pure, majestic and liberating beauty.
                   Even fewer would ever believe the realization and truth obtained in that awe-inspiring moment of before thinking mind.
                   At once she proclaimed: "This is no coconut-flower, this is a mirror!
                   My body is the coconut and my soul is the flower.
                   I have hurt myself and I must heal myself". </p>
                <p>And so she began the lifelong journey of transmuting her course shell into a transparent casing as she learned to share this wonderful gift with the world the best way she knew how - by infecting others with the pure joy emanating from deep within her soul.</p>
                <p>Many people would never understand her method of transmuting her opaque body into a transparent body, but the reward and self fulfillment would surely reach those who understand and benefit from such transparency.
                   And over time she learned to realize that her indwelling flower was indeed the greatest gift she could ever receive.
                   And that was more than enough to overcome all the ignorance in the world and discover the true purpose of life.</p>
